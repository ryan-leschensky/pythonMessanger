# Python Encyption Activity

In order to do this activity, go to the [my_encryption.py] file and fill in the necessary functions.

```python
@staticmethod
def encrypt(message, key):
    # TODO code here
    return message

@staticmethod
def decrypt(message, key):
    # TODO code here
    return message
```

Once you are done filling in said functions, go to the [main.py] file and hit run. This should open up a window in which
you can test your code to see if it works or not.

```bash
py .\main.py
```

Once you're done with this project, make sure to save your code since this helper class that you've made will be
needed for a later activity.

[my_encryption.py]: encryption/my_encryption.py
